# Wowks in Pwogwess (WIP)

Scawwy Howwow Theatre presents an opportunity for new and experienced
screenwriters and playwrights: **Wowks in Pwogwess (WIP)**. WIP is a monthly
script workshop series for screenwriters and playwrights presenting works in
progress. We accept works at any stage in the development process, and writers
may choose between a cold read, a reading with only a few rehearsals, or a
staged reading. Presentations will be closed to the public, and writers may
choose whether or not to recieve feedback on their work.

Performances will take place the last Friday of every month, at 7pm Pacific
Time(US)/9pm Eastern Time (US).
